<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p class=scripturehead>John&nbsp;15:1–8&nbsp;English Standard&nbsp;Version</p>

<p class=Scripture>15 “I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. 2&nbsp;Every
branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does
bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. 3&nbsp;Already you are clean
because of the word that I have spoken to you. 4&nbsp;Abide in me, and I in
you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine,
neither can you, unless you abide in me. 5&nbsp;I am the vine; you are the
branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit,
for apart from me you can do nothing. 6&nbsp;If anyone does not abide in me he
is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown
into the fire, and burned. 7&nbsp;If you abide in me, and my words abide in
you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 8&nbsp;By this my
Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.</p>

<p class=Body>Let’s review what we learned in our previous message on&nbsp;pruning:</p>

<p class=bullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Pruning is cutting away branches on a plant so that the plant can
be fruitful and healthy. For example, when a gardener diligently prunes a
rosebush, that bush will produce beautiful and full&nbsp;roses.</p>

<p class=bullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A gardener prunes three types of branches and buds. First are
healthy buds or branches that are not the best ones. Second, there are sick
branches that will not get well, and third, there are branches that need to be
removed for the healthy ones to&nbsp;thrive.</p>

<p class=bullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Plants that bear flowers and fruits always produce more buds than
the plant can sustain. These plants need a gardener to ensure they produce flowers
and&nbsp;fruits.</p>

<p class=bullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>God is the gardener, Jesus is the vine, and we are the branches.
God will prune the Church to ensure we produce maximum spiritual fruit (John&nbsp;15:8).</p>

<h2>How the Father Prunes&nbsp;Us</h2>

<p class=scripturehead>John&nbsp;15:7&nbsp;English Standard&nbsp;Version</p>

<p class=Scripture>7&nbsp;If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask
whatever you wish, and it will be done for&nbsp;you.</p>

<p class=Body>In this message, we will explore how the Father prunes us. Our
answer is in verse&nbsp;7. The Father prunes us with the Word of&nbsp;God.</p>

<p class=Body>Remember, pruning involves cutting. As we abide in the Word of
God, that is, read, study, and prayerfully meditate upon Scripture, we will
experience cutting conviction and stinging correction (Prov. 6:23; Acts&nbsp;2:37).
That is normal! It is <em>abnormal</em> to read the Word of God and not be corrected!</p>

<p class=Body>Since the primary way that the Father prunes his people is
through the Word of God, we must be diligent to abide in Scripture so we can be
sensitive to what the Father wants to prune in our&nbsp;lives, such as:</p>

<p class=bullet>Good activities we are not called to&nbsp;do;</p>

<p class=bullet>Good ministries that have come to an&nbsp;end;</p>

<p class=bullet>Dead works that hinder us spiritually.</p>

<h3>An Example Of&nbsp;Pruning</h3>

<p class=scripturehead>Acts&nbsp;14:27–28&nbsp;English Standard Version</p>

<p class=Scripture>7&nbsp;And when they arrived and gathered the church
together, they declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened
a door of faith to the Gentiles. 28&nbsp;And they remained no little time with
the disciples.</p>

<p class=scripturehead>Acts&nbsp;15:1–2&nbsp;Expanded&nbsp;Bible</p>

<p class=Scripture>15&nbsp;Then some people came to Antioch from Judea and
began teaching the Gentile believers&nbsp;[L&#8239;brothers (and sisters)]:
“You cannot be saved if you are not circumcised ·as Moses taught
us&nbsp;[L&#8239;according to the custom of Moses; compare&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.17.9-Gen.17.14&amp;version=EXB">Gen.
17:9–14</a>].”&nbsp;2&nbsp;Paul and Barnabas ·were against this teaching and
argued&nbsp;[L&#8239;had no small argument and debate]&nbsp;with them about it.
So the church ·decided to send&nbsp;[commissioned; appointed]&nbsp;Paul,
Barnabas, and some others to Jerusalem where they could talk more about this
disagreement with the apostles and elders.</p>

<p class=Body>Paul and Barnabas had completed a mission in which many Gentiles
had come to saving faith in Jesus. A sect of Christians from Jerusalem came and
told Paul and Barnabas that the converted Gentiles had to follow the Old
Testament to be right with God. If ever there was a time when the Father needed
to prune the Church, it was&nbsp;now.</p>

<p class=Body>As a reminder, at this time, the only Bible Christians had was
the Old Testament. Paul and Barnabas preached that Christians did not have to
keep the Law to be right with God, which was a radical concept given the long
history of Jews following the Law. The opponents to Paul and Barnabas believed
that believers needed to trust Jesus <em>and </em>observe<em> </em>Moses’
teaching to be right with&nbsp;God. The churches in Antioch sought counsel from
the Christian leaders in Jerusalem to settle this debate.</p>

<p class=Body>The apostles in Jerusalem concluded that the Jewish and Gentile
believers did not need to keep the law of Moses to be saved. In doing so, the
Holy Spirit removed a deadly doctrine that threatened the vitality of the&nbsp;Church.</p>

<h3>Resistance To&nbsp;Pruning</h3>

<p class=Body>We must note that despite the decision of the Apostles and church
elders, some in the church could not accept this decision. At first, they
started as pious Jewish believers who were misinformed about their faith in
Christ. However, they couldn’t receive correction. Their pride caused them to
change into enemies of the faith, and they worked against the Gospel, hounding
Paul and others, seeking to subvert the work of missions to the Gentiles.</p>

<p class=Body>Even today, one of the persistent heresies in the church are
false teachers who try to convince believers that they must observe Old
Testament practices to be right with God. Often, these are well-meaning,
intelligent believers who cannot accept correction. Instead of receiving the
discipline of the word, their pride transforms them into enemies of&nbsp;grace.</p>

<p class=Body>The New Testament epistles are replete with examples of
individuals who resist the Father’s correction from the Word of God. Unlike
rose bushes and pear trees, humans can resist&nbsp;pruning! We can protect
ourselves against becoming an enemy of grace by being instantly responsive to
God’s correction in the following ways:</p>

<p class=bullet><span class=MsoIntenseEmphasis><b><span style='color:black;
font-style:normal'>Read the Bible regularly.</span></b></span> When you read a
passage that exposes sin or wrongdoing, repent and ask the Holy Spirit to help
you overcome that&nbsp;sin.</p>

<p class=bullet><span class=MsoIntenseEmphasis><b><span style='color:black;
font-style:normal'>Be quick to admit you are wrong, misinformed, or in error.</span></b></span>
There is no shame in that. Being in error is part of being human. Jesus gave us
the Holy Spirit to lead us from error into truth (John&nbsp;14:16–17).</p>

<p class=bullet><span class=MsoIntenseEmphasis><b><span style='color:black;
font-style:normal'>Remember that the Bible cuts!</span></b></span><b> It is
sharper than a two-edged sword (Heb. 4:12).</b> Therefore, while temporarily
unpleasant, the piercing, cutting, and jabbing of the Scripture is for our
good. Don’t resist it, but rather give thanks for&nbsp;it.</p>

<h2>Application of Pruning at the Church&nbsp;Level</h2>

<p class=scripturehead>2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:7–13&nbsp;New Living Translation</p>

<p class=ScriptureCxSpFirst>7&nbsp;Since you excel in so many ways—in your
faith, your gifted speakers, your knowledge, your enthusiasm, and your love
from us—I want you to excel also in this gracious act of&nbsp;giving.</p>

<p class=ScriptureCxSpMiddle>8&nbsp;I am not commanding you to do this. But I
am testing how genuine your love is by comparing it with the eagerness of the
other churches.</p>

<p class=ScriptureCxSpMiddle>9&nbsp;You know the generous grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ. Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by
his poverty he could make you&nbsp;rich.</p>

<p class=ScriptureCxSpLast>10&nbsp;Here is my advice: It would be good for you
to finish what you started a year ago. Last year you were the first who wanted
to give, and you were the first to begin doing it. 11&nbsp;Now you should
finish what you started. Let the eagerness you showed in the beginning be
matched now by your giving. Give in proportion to what you have. 12&nbsp;Whatever
you give is acceptable if you give it eagerly. And give according to what you
have, not what you don’t have. 13&nbsp;Of course, I don’t mean your giving
should make life easy for others and hard for yourselves. I only mean that
there should be some equality.</p>

<p class=Body>If you face a financial challenge, allow the Word of God to speak
to and prune you to meet it adequately. We serve the most high God, who is the
creator of heaven and earth. There is no god above Him! All riches, honor, and
power belong to him, and he has given all authority in heaven and on earth to
Jesus Christ. Jesus has been given a name greater than every other name, not
only in this age but in every age.</p>

<p class=Body>The Lord Jesus is the mediator of a better covenant based on
better promises. As new creatures in Christ Jesus, we are not living under the Old
Covenant but in the New Covenant through Christ. We are not sacrificing animals,
giving grain offerings, or observing feast days to be right with God. Our right
standing with God comes exclusively through faith in the finished work of Jesus&nbsp;Christ.
Because Jesus finished his work and obtained for us eternal redemption, there
is no need for us to bargain with God. We are his children; we come before his
throne in the name of children, boldly make our requests known, and receive the
answers to our petitions by faith in his&nbsp;Word.</p>

<h3>No More&nbsp;Gimmicks</h3>

<p class=Body>As believers, we do not need any gimmicks, promotions, or clever tactics
to get us to give. All we need to do is to be obedient to our covenant. God has
clearly shown us in&nbsp;2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8,9&nbsp;what we are required
to do as a church&nbsp;body:</p>

<p class=bullet>To give with the right attitude, that is, eagerly,
sacrificially, and with love in our&nbsp;hearts,</p>

<p class=bullet>To give according to what we have, not according to what we do
not have,&nbsp;and</p>

<p class=bullet>To not give under pressure.</p>

<h4>Pruning #1 </h4>

<p class=Body>Some of us have slowed considerably in giving because we do not
see progress. We think, “I am tired of putting money into my local church.
Nothing ever seems to get done. I don’t want to put good money after&nbsp;bad.”
Here is how the word will prune that attitude:</p>

<p class=bullet>Ultimately, your money is not yours. We are called to give a
portion of it to God’s work (Provers&nbsp;3:9–10)</p>

<p class=bullet>If God has planted you at a church, you are called to support
this ministry financially (1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;9:1–12).</p>

<h4>Pruning #2</h4>

<p class=Body>Some of you have slowed or stopped giving because you are looking
at circumstances. You are either looking at circumstances in your life or the
life of your church. You are looking hard at your retirement accounts and financial
obligations. Perhaps your local church badly needs repair, and you are
discouraged by how it looks.  Your attitude is, “I don’t have enough to sow. I only
have enough money to live day by&nbsp;day.”</p>

<p class=Body>Here is the correcting word:</p>

<p class=Body>In&nbsp;1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;17, God commanded a widow at Zarephath
to feed Elijah during a famine. Even though God spoke to her, she was reluctant
to follow through because there was no food and water in the land, and she only
had enough food to feed herself and her son for one more day. Her obedience in
trusting God by giving to the man of God first made all the difference in her
family's survival.</p>

<p class=Body>Note that God commanded the widow to give to the man of God
first. In other words, Elijah would benefit before she and her family would
benefit. That was a hard choice, but if the widow never gave to Elijah, she
would have died. But because she was obedient, she not only lived, she
prospered. That is how God&nbsp;works.</p>

<h4>Pruning #3</h4>

<p class=Body>Some of you are just being sluggish and listless in your giving.
Unless your pastor or a deacon rides you hard, you won’t give to the church.
Here is the correcting word:</p>

<p class=Body>It is time to grow up as a believer. You don’t need a pledge
card, a matching drive, or any special event or announcement to give. That is
for babies. You are a mature believer who has walked with the Lord for years.
You have the Bible. You should know what to&nbsp;do.</p>

<p class=Body>I’m not saying it's wrong for church leaders to send letters or
remind believers of their commitments. I am saying that believers must realize
that giving to their local church is their responsibility (and privilege).</p>

<p class=Body>After we get paid, the first check we should write should be for
the Lord. What is so hard about&nbsp;that?</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p class=Body>Although I used our attitudes and behavior regarding giving
financial gifts to the church, the Lord uses His Word to speak to all areas of
our lives. Let’s be diligent about keeping the Scriptures a daily part of our
lives and sensitive to the Holy Spirit's voice when he corrects us with the
Word of God.</p>

<p class=Body><span class=close>In the name of God, Amen.</span></p>

<h1>Scriptures</h1>

<p class=scripturehead>John&nbsp;15:1–8&nbsp;English Standard&nbsp;Version</p>

<p class=Scripture>15 “I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. 2&nbsp;Every
branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does
bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. 3&nbsp;Already you are clean
because of the word that I have spoken to you. 4&nbsp;Abide in me, and I in
you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine,
neither can you, unless you abide in me. 5&nbsp;I am the vine; you are the
branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit,
for apart from me you can do nothing. 6&nbsp;If anyone does not abide in me he
is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown
into the fire, and burned. 7&nbsp;If you abide in me, and my words abide in
you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 8&nbsp;By this my
Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.</p>

<p class=scripturehead>Acts&nbsp;14:27–28&nbsp;English Standard Version</p>

<p class=Scripture>7&nbsp;And when they arrived and gathered the church
together, they declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened
a door of faith to the Gentiles. 28&nbsp;And they remained no little time with
the disciples.</p>

<p class=scripturehead>Acts&nbsp;15:1–2&nbsp;Expanded&nbsp;Bible</p>

<p class=Scripture>15&nbsp;Then some people came to Antioch from Judea and
began teaching the Gentile believers&nbsp;[L&#8239;brothers (and sisters)]:
“You cannot be saved if you are not circumcised ·as Moses taught
us&nbsp;[L&#8239;according to the custom of Moses; compare&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.17.9-Gen.17.14&amp;version=EXB">Gen.
17:9–14</a>].”&nbsp;2&nbsp;Paul and Barnabas ·were against this teaching and
argued&nbsp;[L&#8239;had no small argument and debate]&nbsp;with them about it.
So the church ·decided to send&nbsp;[commissioned; appointed]&nbsp;Paul,
Barnabas, and some others to Jerusalem where they could talk more about this
disagreement with the apostles and elders.</p>

<p class=scripturehead>2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:7–13&nbsp;New Living Translation</p>

<p class=ScriptureCxSpFirst>7&nbsp;Since you excel in so many ways—in your
faith, your gifted speakers, your knowledge, your enthusiasm, and your love
from us—I want you to excel also in this gracious act of&nbsp;giving.</p>

<p class=ScriptureCxSpMiddle>8&nbsp;I am not commanding you to do this. But I
am testing how genuine your love is by comparing it with the eagerness of the
other churches.</p>

<p class=ScriptureCxSpMiddle>9&nbsp;You know the generous grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ. Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by
his poverty he could make you&nbsp;rich.</p>

<p class=ScriptureCxSpLast>10&nbsp;Here is my advice: It would be good for you
to finish what you started a year ago. Last year you were the first who wanted
to give, and you were the first to begin doing it. 11&nbsp;Now you should
finish what you started. Let the eagerness you showed in the beginning be
matched now by your giving. Give in proportion to what you have. 12&nbsp;Whatever
you give is acceptable if you give it eagerly. And give according to what you
have, not what you don’t have. 13&nbsp;Of course, I don’t mean your giving
should make life easy for others and hard for yourselves. I only mean that
there should be some equality.</p>
